<p>Front-end development and design for the local sock company. They needed an e-commerce store and WordPress blog to match their new branding. To make that happen I work mostly on site with the owner and office manager to guide me in the right direction. To build the CS-Cart and WordPress templates I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.</p>
